# Joint Data & Model Parallelism

This repository contains an implementation of a distributed deep learning algorithm, using joint data & model parallelism training.

## How to run

1. Install environment using conda
2. run the shell scripts
3. b1 contains only model parallelism using microbatches
4. b2 contains model parallelism with microbatches jointly with data paralellism
